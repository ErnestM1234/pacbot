# Game Engine Communication Information

The PacBot game uses WiFi to send the game state to participating robots; thus all participating teams must have WiFi compatible robots. To do this, PacBot uses Robomodules, a custom Python3 framework for handling communication between modular components using TCP traffic. The game uses a single Robomodules server; teams' bots will connect to this server to receive information about the Pacman game state. Specific documentation for Robomodules can be found here: https://github.com/HarvardURC/robomodules

To connect to the running game engine, teams must run their own Robomodules ProtoModule. A sample module is in this folder. The custom module is a subclass of the ProtoModule class. The module is initialized with a connection to the game engine server. When an instance of the module is running (by calling the run method), the method msg_received is called whenever the module receives a message from the game engine server. If the msg_type is MsgType.LIGHT_STATE, this message is the game state. This state contains the game state information (as outlined in the rules for the game). If desired, the tick function is helpful for running custom code at a desired frequency (in Hz). More details on how to use Robomodules in your own project if desired can be found in the Robomodules documentation.
