# BotCode

This is the code that runs on the pacbot! There are a few important files on the top level, but most of of the code is sorted into directories, each with its own README.

#### Specific File Descriptions
- _Master.hpp_: This file calls its on_init() method every single tick. All the work that is supposed to happen all the time should be called through this file.
